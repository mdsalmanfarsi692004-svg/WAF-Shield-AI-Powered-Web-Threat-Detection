**🔍 Overview**

Traditional firewalls rely on static rules (signatures) which often fail against Zero-Day attacks. WAF Shield is an intelligent security system that analyzes AWS CloudWatch Traffic Logs to identify anomalous behavior.

Using a trained Random Forest Classifier, it distinguishes between Benign (Safe) and Suspicious (DDoS/Exfiltration) traffic patterns instantly, providing Security Analysts with a modern dashboard for threat monitoring.

**🌟 Key Features**

1. 🔍 Real-Time Anomaly Detection

Input: Analyzes packet size (Bytes In, Bytes Out), Port (80, 443), and Request Time.

Output: Instant classification as Safe or Malicious.

Accuracy: ~98% detection rate on test data.

2. 🛡️ Interactive Traffic Simulator

Allows users to manually tweak network parameters to test the firewall's robustness.

Simulates scenarios like Data Exfiltration (High Bytes Out) or DDoS (Rapid small packets).

3. 🚨 Actionable Intelligence

Displays a Confidence Score (e.g., "99.2% sure this is an attack").

Recommends specific actions:

Block Source IP

Reset Connection

Flag for Forensics

**🛠️ Tech Stack**

Frontend,Streamlit (Python framework)

Backend Logic,Python 3.9+

Machine Learning,"Scikit-Learn, Random Forest, XGBoost"

Data Processing,"Pandas, NumPy"

Model Saving,Joblib (Serialized models)

Dataset,AWS CloudWatch Logs (40k+ records)

**📊 Model Architecture**

We compared multiple algorithms to find the best balance between speed and accuracy:

Algorithm	          Accuracy	      Precision	Status

Random Forest	      98.4%	High	    ✅ Selected

XGBoost	            97.8%	High	    ⚠️ Backup

Logistic Regression	89.2%	Medium	  ❌ Rejected

The Random Forest model was chosen for its robustness against overfitting on tabular log data.

**🔮 Future Scope**

Automated IP Blocking: Integrate with iptables or AWS WAF to block IPs automatically.

Geo-Tagging: Visualize attack origins on a world map.

Deep Learning: Implement LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models for sequence-based attack detection.
